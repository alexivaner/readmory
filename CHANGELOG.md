# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — Public beta

- Redesigned reading share cards with Forest and Paper styles, clearer time qualifiers and book rankings, proportional covers and an improved desktop/mobile export preview. Optional detailed cards add activity charts, session and time-coverage statistics, and up to six ranked books. Statistics and book details remain generated locally.

- Skip protected macOS and Windows system folders during read-only USB scans, including `.TemporaryItems`, which Chrome reports as a filesystem write error. Source-folder read failures now include the affected path and recovery steps.

- Fall back atomically to IndexedDB when browser filesystem writes are blocked or unsupported; remember the saved backend across reloads, retain existing libraries on failed saves, and test storage failures in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit.

- More visible Ko-fi support buttons and a dismissible inline reminder after five minutes of eligible visible use, limited to once per 30 days in this browser.

- Recover validated Kobalt tables around damaged indexes, retain the fullest session evidence across snapshots, and list available calendar months with active-day counts.

- Calendar-first reading view with unified measured/reconstructed monthly time, approximate labels, grouped day details and active-date month navigation. Import actions stay above collapsed review/history; skipped-source warnings remain visible.

- Year/month reading statistics, book rankings and locally generated PNG share cards with cached covers and privacy controls. Earlier annotation dates now appear as activity evidence without inventing hours.

- Unified native Kobo event history, measured analytics sessions, Kobalt and KOReader activity. Added reader coverage, evidence labels, conservative overlap handling, second-level durations, checksum-based KOReader linking and tolerance for sub-second Kobalt clock drift.

- Fixed whole-folder USB cover imports: cached shelf images are processed before EPUBs in bounded batches, instead of exhausting a shared 128 MB allowance. Added cover counts and measured batch progress.

- Dedicated personal notes and reflections view, searchable with reader provenance and passage context.
- Detailed monthly reading calendar with per-day sessions and reader filters; source totals never invent daily history.
- Larger typography and responsive controls throughout the workspace.

- Readmory identity: forest/sage/cream themes, editorial typography, book/bookmark mark, owner-supplied R artwork, and offline brand assets. Existing vaults, backups and URLs remain compatible.

- Local imports for Kobo, KOReader and Kobalt, with previews separated from the reading shelf.
- Guided USB import with platform-specific file help; compact reader comparison cards with expandable history and book-match controls.
- Bookshelf, annotations, knowledge topics, reflections, activity and portable backups.
- Completion history with explicit limits on inferred rereading evidence.
- Combined shelf cards for verified file/ISBN matches; reversible manual combination and source-specific progress/history.
- Optional Open Library metadata/covers with bounded caching, retry controls and provider backoff.
- Static hosting, offline shell, welcome page and optional Ko-fi support.

This beta preserves reader-specific records. Exact lifetime reread counts and fully reconciled reading-time totals are unavailable when sources do not provide that evidence.
